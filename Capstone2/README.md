## Capstone 2

This is the second capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track. In this project, we collect, explore, analyze, and predict NFL fantasy football points for quarterbacks. We aim to predict fantasy football points for FanDuel with higher accuracy than paid-for projection services. We use regression techniques for numeric predictions after exploratory data analysis to achieve projections that outperform paid-for projections. FanDuel fantasy football players will benefit greatly from our models. The quarterback position is the focus of this project, as it is arguably the most important piece of the fantasy player's lineup. For future work, we will dive into the other positions, and focus on building complete FanDuel lineups.
