# Springboard

This repository contains both capstone projects that were completed for Springboard's Data Science Career Track. The projects look into NFL data, and aim to predict outcomes of contests, as well as fantasy points for players.

Additionally, all coding assignments are within this repository within the 'assignments' folder.
